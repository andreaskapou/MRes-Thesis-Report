\section{Synthetic Experiments} \label{integr-synth-exper-sect}
In this section we present experiments based on synthetic data that illustrate certain features of the BCC model. Initially, we describe how the synthetic data were generated. Then, we experiment with the synthetic data to evaluate the accuracy of the model in estimating the adherence parameter $\alpha$, but also the clustering accuracy. Finally, the mixing of the chains and convergence diagnostics for the MCMC simulations will be demonstrated.
