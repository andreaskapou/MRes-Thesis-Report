\section{Motivation} \label{motivation-l}
DNA methylation is a well studied chemical modification of DNA, which occurs when a methyl group is attached to a DNA nucleotide. It is associated with diverse biological processes of direct clinical relevance, including gene and transposon silencing, X-chromosome inactivation, and  genomic imprinting \citep{Li1993, Mohandas1981}. In mammals,  methylation is observed almost exclusively on cytosine residues in the context of CpG dinucleotides (\ie C followed by G, where p stands for the phosphate group linking C and G). DNA methylation is said to be a true \emph{epigenetic modification}, since its mechanism of inheritance during the cell cycle is well established \citep{Law2010}. 

Due to the increased vulnerability of the 5-methylcytosines to randomly deaminate to thymine, most of the genome is depleted from CpG dinucleotides \citep{Scarano1967}, except from small regions termed \emph{CpG islands} \citep{Bird2002}. A CpG island (CGI) is a sequence of at least 200 bp with a greater number of CpG sites than expected from its GC content. These regions are often GC rich, typically undermethylated, and are found upstream of many mammalian genes \citep{Law2010}. 

Bisulphite treatment \citep{Frommer1992} followed by next generation sequencing (NGS) can be used to measure the methylation level of the genomic DNA at a single-nucleotide resolution, and is termed Whole-Genome Bisulphite Sequencing (WGBS). Sodium bisulphite efficiently deaminates unmethylated cytosines to uracils and leaves the 5-Methylcytosines unchanged. During sequencing, unmethylated cytosines are read out as thymines. Reads are then aligned to a reference genome allowing changes of C to T during the mapping procedure. 

The outline of the bisulphite treatment of a sample DNA sequence is shown in \emph{Figure \ref{bisulphite-pic}}.

In WGBS experiments, the DNA molecules often originate from distinct cells, as a consequence, the methylation state of a particular cytosine may be different across DNA molecules. Hence, in the context of WGBS experiments the methylation of a particular cytosine is described as \emph{methylation level}, which is the fraction of the molecules in the sample containing 5-Methylcytosine at the specific genomic locus \citep{Schultz2012}.

\cite{Meissner2005} developed a technique, termed Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), for analyzing the genome-wide methylation profiles efficiently, at lower cost and with greater coverage of CpG dense regions. This method, combines bisulphite treatment and restriction enzymes, such as MspI, to generate a 'reduced representation' of the genome of a strain, tissue or cell type which have a high CpG content \citep{Meissner2005}. 

What is often of practical interest is identifying the methylation profile of a genomic region, \eg the methylation profile of a promoter, so by independently looking at individual cytosines will not take us far in analyzing the data and uncovering important biological processes. This means that the higher-order changes in the methylation profiles, such as their shape, should be considered. Taking into consideration that the methylation level of a CpG site is highly correlated with the methylation level of the surrounding CpGs (\ie spatial co-dependence), \cite{Mayo2014} developed M$^3$D, which is non-parametric kernel-based method for statistical identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This project makes the same assumption about the \emph{spatial co-dependence} of CpGs, but is mainly concentrated in clustering together similar methylation profiles.
