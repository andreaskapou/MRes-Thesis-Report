\section{Outline} \label{outline-intro-l}
The rest of this document is organized as follows: In Chapter \ref{background-chapter} we provide the molecular biology background related to this project, then we briefly introduce core machine learning concepts, and finally we describe mixture models. Chapter \ref{dataset-chapter} describes the NGS datasets that will be used in this project. In Chapter \ref{model-meth-chapter} we introduce a novel method for mixture modelling DNA methylation profiles. Chapter \ref{integrative-clustering-chapter} is concerned with integrative clustering from multisource data. Finally, in Chapter \ref{conclusion-chapter} we summarize and discuss the main contributions of this project and suggest some directions for future work.
