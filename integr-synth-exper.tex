\section{Synthetic Experiments} \label{integr-synth-exper-sect}
In this section we present some experiments based on synthetic data that illustrate certain features of the BCC model. Initially, we will describe how the synthetic data were generated. Then, we will experiment with these data to evaluate the accuracy of the model in estimating the adherence parameters $\alpha$, but also the clustering accuracy. Finally, mixing and convergence tests of the MCMC chains will be demonstrated.
