Initially I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisor Guido Sanguinetti for his advice and guidance throughout the duration of this project. His inspirational comments and the discussions we had throughout these stressful months made it possible to overcome problems that arose during the preparation of this thesis.

Amongst many others I would like to thank my colleagues from Guido's group and from the CDT in Data Science for the various discussions and the morning coffees we had together.

Undoubtedly, I would like to thank my family for the incomparable understanding and goodwill that they showed throughout the preparation of my dissertation; I hope this piece will make the proud. Finally, I would like to thank Erisa for her huge support, encouragement and endless patience with me.
