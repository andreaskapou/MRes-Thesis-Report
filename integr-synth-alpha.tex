\subsection{Adherence Parameter Accuracy } \label{integr-synth-alpha-sect}
In this experiment, we want to find if the BCC model can estimate the adherence parameter with reasonable accuracy. Since, we have the ground truth values for $\alpha$, from the synthetic data, we can compare them with the estimated $\hat{\alpha}$ returned from BCC. \emph{Fig. } displays the estimated $\hat{\alpha}$ (on the y-axis) versus the true $\alpha$ (on the x-axis) for the 100 realizations of the synthetic data. For each realization, we show the mean value of the estimated $\hat{\alpha}$ together with its $95$\% credible interval based on the $2.5 - 97.5$ percentiles of the MCMC simulations.
