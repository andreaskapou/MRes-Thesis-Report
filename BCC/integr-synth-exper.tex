\section{Synthetic Experiments} \label{integr-synth-exper-sect}
In this section we present some experiments based on synthetic data that illustrate certain features of the BCC model. Initially, we will describe how the synthetic data were generated. Then, we will experiment with these data to evaluate the accuracy of the model in estimating the adherence parameter $\alpha$, but also the clustering accuracy. Finally, the mixing of the chains and convergence diagnostics of the MCMC simulations will be demonstrated.
